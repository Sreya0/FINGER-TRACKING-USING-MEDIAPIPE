We implement a Deep Learning approach to detect the features (ﬁngers in this case).
First, we train a palm detector, since estimating bounding boxes of rigid objects like  palms and ﬁsts is signiﬁcantly simpler than detecting hands with articulated ﬁngers
Second, we use an encoder-decoder feature extractor for a larger scene-context  awareness even for small objects.
After running palm detection over the whole image, our subsequent hand landmark  model performs precise landmark localization of 21 2.5D coordinates inside the  detected hand regions via regression.
The model learns a consistent internal hand pose representation and is robust even to  partially visible hands and self-occlusions.
